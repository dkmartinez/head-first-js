<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>Think of the object as something that holds all your names and values ( in other words, your properties) together</p>
    <ul>
        <li ><a href="#properties">Properties</li></a>
        <li><a href="#behavior">Behavior</li></a>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
        <p>Here's our Car represented as a software object</p>
        <p>The car hasa set of Properties</p>
        <p>Each property has a name and a value </p>
        <p>Only some real-world properties are going to be useful in software</p>
    <h2>How Properties work</h2>

        <p>How to access a property. To access a rpoperty in an object, start with the object name, follow it with a period (dot) and then use the property name.</p>
        <p>How to change a property. You can change the value of a property at any time. All you need to do is assign the property to a new value. </p>
        <p>You can use an object's property just like you use a variable, except you need to use dot (.) notation to access the property in the object.</p>
